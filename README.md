# 📊Pricing Optimization & Linear Regression in SQL

## 🔍 Overview

This project focuses on using SQL for pricing optimization and linear regression to help businesses determine the optimal price point for maximizing revenue. By leveraging SQL’s statistical functions, we model quantity sold as a function of price and analyze demand patterns. The project is structured as a code-along tutorial, integrating exploratory data analysis, regression modeling, and optimization techniques.

## 💰 Business Impact

Pricing plays a crucial role in revenue generation. If products are priced too high, sales decline; if priced too low, revenue potential is lost. Many business leaders lack analytical tools for pricing optimization, leading to suboptimal decisions.
✅ This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to:

📉 Analyze price elasticity of demand
📈 Build predictive models for revenue estimation
💡 Find the price point that maximizes revenue

## 🛠️ Technological Implementation

This project is implemented using SQL with aggregate functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and regression analysis.
🔑 Key components include:

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding price, quantity sold, and revenue relationships
📐 Linear Regression in SQL – Using SQL’s CORR(), REGR_SLOPE(), and REGR_INTERCEPT() to model demand
🧮 Quadratic Regression for Revenue Optimization – Finding the price that maximizes revenue using derivative-based optimization
🔄 CTEs & Subqueries – Structuring complex SQL queries for efficiency

## 🚀 Summary

This project demonstrates the power of SQL for data-driven decision-making in pricing strategy. By combining statistical modeling with SQL capabilities, we derive actionable insights for businesses to maximize profitability through optimized pricing.
